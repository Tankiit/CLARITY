You've never seen White Plains like this! The service was fantastic but the view was horrible. The food was very good.
I've been to Teatro many times over the past 5 years and the food has always been excellent, the service right on for the restarant and never a disappointment. The decor however is very dated.
band for us older folks. Two of our party could not even talk to each other.
