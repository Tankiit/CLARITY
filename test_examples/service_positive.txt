You've never seen White Plains like this! The service was fantastic but the view was horrible. The food was very good.
The food was very good and the service was exceptional, but it seemed a bit overpriced to me compared to some of the other upscale pizza places.
Beautiful setting. Staff was very attentive. Lunch menu offered good options. Note sandwiches are very generous you might want to share.
I've been to Teatro many times over the past 5 years and the food has always been excellent, the service right on for the restarant and never a disappointment. The decor however is very dated.
Good. Often when we've gone to Sette Bello, the service has been terrible. HOwever, this evening the service was quite god.
Great food, quiet ambiance, and quality service. Love coming here.
Service was excellent with the server responsive and informed on all requests. The ambiance was romantic with a quiet excellence.
