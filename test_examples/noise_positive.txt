Unfortunately we had a bad dining experience due to our waitress... Slow service, wrong food, poor management, but incredible food and a nice quiet place.
The location of Naples 45 can't be beat  to have a business breakfast meeting. However, the service was terrible. I was constantly searching for the waitperson.
Great food, quiet ambiance, and quality service. Love coming here.
Service was excellent with the server responsive and informed on all requests. The ambiance was romantic with a quiet excellence.
