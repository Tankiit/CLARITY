Beautiful setting. Staff was very attentive. Lunch menu offered good options. Note sandwiches are very generous you might want to share.
The location of Naples 45 can't be beat  to have a business breakfast meeting. However, the service was terrible. I was constantly searching for the waitperson.
Greatly disappointed. Not a pleasant experience. Service rude and non-attentive. Food not hot. Only thing it had going was the decor and music. Not what it has been in the past.
Great food, quiet ambiance, and quality service. Love coming here.
I went here for 2010 Restaurant Week and it was awful! The mussel appetizer was vomit inducing! it does have a nice, romantic atmosphere however. I will not be eating here again.
Service was excellent with the server responsive and informed on all requests. The ambiance was romantic with a quiet excellence.
Food was a little bland in some cases, otherwise ok. Seating is spaced and is very intimate.
