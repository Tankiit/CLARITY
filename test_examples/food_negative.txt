The meatballs and sauce was disgusting!!!
Greatly disappointed. Not a pleasant experience. Service rude and non-attentive. Food not hot. Only thing it had going was the decor and music. Not what it has been in the past.
What a waste. Was more expensive than we thought. Food was tasteless. Service average.  Would not go back. All four of us felt the same way.
I went here for 2010 Restaurant Week and it was awful! The mussel appetizer was vomit inducing! it does have a nice, romantic atmosphere however. I will not be eating here again.
Food was a little bland in some cases, otherwise ok. Seating is spaced and is very intimate.
Did not get a good value for the cost. Portions were small, cost was too high. Too much noise from kitchen.
