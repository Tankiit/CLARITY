Too much to brag about here. Just great Italian food. Fancy wine list, full of California
Unfortunately we had a bad dining experience due to our waitress... Slow service, wrong food, poor management, but incredible food and a nice quiet place.
Italian food in central Texas. Wonderful dining experience.
You've never seen White Plains like this! The service was fantastic but the view was horrible. The food was very good.
The food was very good and the service was exceptional, but it seemed a bit overpriced to me compared to some of the other upscale pizza places.
Beautiful setting. Staff was very attentive. Lunch menu offered good options. Note sandwiches are very generous you might want to share.
I've been to Teatro many times over the past 5 years and the food has always been excellent, the service right on for the restarant and never a disappointment. The decor however is very dated.
Limoncello has excellent Italian food. So good, that it tastes homemade. The only drawback is that the service sucks in the restaurant.
Great food, quiet ambiance, and quality service. Love coming here.
