Limoncello has excellent Italian food. So good, that it tastes homemade. The only drawback is that the service sucks in the restaurant.
What a waste. Was more expensive than we thought. Food was tasteless. Service average.  Would not go back. All four of us felt the same way.
Food was a little bland in some cases, otherwise ok. Seating is spaced and is very intimate.
Did not get a good value for the cost. Portions were small, cost was too high. Too much noise from kitchen.
band for us older folks. Two of our party could not even talk to each other.
