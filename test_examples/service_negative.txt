Unfortunately we had a bad dining experience due to our waitress... Slow service, wrong food, poor management, but incredible food and a nice quiet place.
The location of Naples 45 can't be beat  to have a business breakfast meeting. However, the service was terrible. I was constantly searching for the waitperson.
Greatly disappointed. Not a pleasant experience. Service rude and non-attentive. Food not hot. Only thing it had going was the decor and music. Not what it has been in the past.
Limoncello has excellent Italian food. So good, that it tastes homemade. The only drawback is that the service sucks in the restaurant.
Waited a very long time for dishes. Bad service.
Very disappointing.
What a waste. Was more expensive than we thought. Food was tasteless. Service average.  Would not go back. All four of us felt the same way.
